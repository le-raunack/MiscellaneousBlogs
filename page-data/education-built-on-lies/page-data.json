What the Indic historians and pro-Hindu people have been saying for a long time, it has materialized just a few days ago (from the time of writing this article).\n<br><br>\nIt seems that someone, and I am not aware who exactly, filed a RTI application asking the sources for NCERT's portrayal of Mughals as <em>daana-veeras</em>, best of donators and the \"number of temples that were repaired by [them]\". Here is the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Abhina_Prakash/status/1349359508166897666?s=20\" traget=\"_blank\">reply</a>.\n<br><br>\nWhat fucking stupidity is this? So, you are telling me that the composers of NCERT history books are AWARE of the fact that, well, these \"facts\" are lies and yet, YET they have continued to include them in the books for YEARS now? What other purpose does this server than desperate attempts to whitewash the asuric deeds of Mughals? What's the point in teaching lies? You and me both know the answer. But of course, depending on your ideology, you may choose to still be a retard.\n<br><br>\nBy the way, this RTI application was filed only for a <em>few</em> instances of such lies. There are many more. One can't go on filing RTI applications for entire chapters now, can they? Or consider this as well, even in your Physical Sciences or Mathematics you are taught the history of such discoveries or conclusions. Who's to say you haven't been lied there?\n<br><br>\nNaturally, while this has thrown the entire Indic cause into raising their voices again, the people who are <em>actually</em> supposed to do something are quiet. Governments runs states. Ecosystems run the narratives and hence get to decide what is \"truth\". Without a change in the ecosystem, get ready to continue the tradition to live in a society built on lies.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Education built on LIES","author":"Raunack Tripathi","tags":["Civilization","History"],"date":"Jan 14th 2021","image":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.251851851851852,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/84067a85ff31ba3458fe242511557480/b94b5/015cover.jpg","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/84067a85ff31ba3458fe242511557480/039ed/015cover.jpg 608w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/84067a85ff31ba3458fe242511557480/b94b5/015cover.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/7a833/person.png","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/c2da5/person.png 270w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/7a833/person.png 300w","sizes":"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"}}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"education-built-on-lies"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2855661546","3649515864","4146590038","63159454"]}

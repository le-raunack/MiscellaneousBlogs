The Valmiki Ramayana and Dvaipayana Mahabharata have acted as pillars supporting Dharma in the form of stories.\n<br><br>\nThe epics, called the <em>Itihasa</em> scriptures, which means \"thus-it-happened\", are similar on the surface. They both talk about the <em>avatara</em>s of Bhagavan Vishnu, Ramachandra and Krishna on Earth and their deeds while on the material planet. They both talk about victory of Dharma over Adharma, have great philosophical imports, describe great wars and the people involved committing to heroic deeds, the antagonists harrassing the primary woman leading to great enmity between the factions. But the stories differ greately from here on out. Let's address them individually.\n<br><br></p>\n<h3>THE VALMIKI RAMAYANA</h3>\n<br>\nThe story of Bhagavan Ramachandra, the greatest of the <strong>Ikshavaku clan</strong> and his great sojourn to the forest has been the single most influencial story in the Indian sub-continent, giving rising 300 versions of the Sanskrit epic in different languages, different regions and different interpretations throughout history, all owing their existence to the Valmiki Ramayana. The strength of the epic lies in the beautiful way Sri Valmiki has presented the story. He could've easily just described the events as they occured. But no, he takes the time to scrutinize not only the environment but also the people and their actions in the story. I am no expert in Sanskrit, hence I do not deserve to comment on the epic's beauty but just listening to someone read it for you, is enough to make you fall in love with the poetry.\n<br><br>\nToday, Bhagavan Ramachandra is an unofficial symbol of the Bharatiya civilization. His exile, his war with Ravana and his <em>pattabhishekam</em> as the supreme sovereign of the Raghuvamsha have been imprinted in the minds of the people who seek his life, thanks to the Ramayana. Valmiki's own life has something to narrate. His transformation from a theif to one of the great composers who ever existed is a story that everyone can find inspiration in.\n<br><br>\nRamayana is a story of good people. Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, Dasharatha, etc., are all genuinely good people as is apparent from their morals and actions. They are altruistic to a fault. Hence, Rama's exile, Dasharatha's passing, Sita's kidnapping, Sita's exile and such other incidents are a tough gulp to swallow. This only strengthens the notion that Dharma is supreme. Personal interests and politics mean nothing when Dharma is at stake.\n<br><br>\nIn parts of Bharata even today, people may not know how to read, but they know the triumph of Rama over Ravana. This isn't just a story of a hero taking down a villian. Ramayana is the representative of this nation's ethics which have continously taught people that tranquillity, Dharma, friends and your close ones are the only things that will help you in your lowest of lows and make you reach highest of highs.\n<br><br>\n<h3>THE DVAIPAYANA MAHABHARATA</h3>\n<br>\nThe ending of Dwapara Yuga and the advent of Kali Yuga meant one thing, Dharma will only decline from now on. In such drastic times, the forces of all gods needed to act in unison. The Dvaipayana Mahabharata, or as it is more popularly called Vyasa Mahabharata is a recording of a really important era in Indian history.\n<br><br>\nThe core of the story is a <strong>gigantic</strong> war between the forces of Pandavas, led by Yuddhishtira and Kouravas, led by Duryodhana. But Mahabharata isn't just limited to that. The name of the story literally means \"The Great Story of Bharatas\", the Pandavas and Kouravas being the descendants of Bharata, the king who conquered all of ancient India. Hence, the story is about the descendants of Bharata who took part in this great war. From Pratapi to Janamejaya, Krishna Dvaipayana records at least 7 generations worth of conflicts surrounding the Bharatas, be they physical, strategic or philosophical. Yes, indeed, the Mahabharata rightfully deserves it's title - <strong>The longest epic in the world</strong>.\n<br><br>\nAs should be clear by now, the Mahabharata is a gigantic story. Taking place almost all over the ancient Indian land, involving people from all over the same. If the Ramayana stands for the beauty that can be brought forth with Sanskrit compositions, the Mahabharata stands for the absolute power that can be conveyed through the language. Vyasa has composed the story in such a way, that translations even in vernacular languages are enough to send shivers down the spine of one reading it. But, indeed, Sanskrit versions are unparralled in describing the events, often comparing the people involved with Indra, Oceans, Elephants, etc., and describing armies in gigantic numbers. One can certianly just call it exaggeration, but man, those exaggerations convey the intensity. I can also talk about Veda Vyasa here, his great contributions to Dharma by preserving the importance of Vedas, <em>Guru-Shishya parampara</em>, etc., but that would be adding too much right now.\n<br><br>\nIn contrast to the Ramayana, the Mahabharata is story that talks about the grey of Dharma. Yuddhishtira is a wise and learnt king, being praised by this family and brahamanas everywhere, but can also wager off his brothers and wife when provoked. Bhishma is hailed as the foremost of people who follow their Dharma, but he can kidnap princesses from other kingdoms and make them marry his relatives. Draupadi, Bhima, Shakuni, Duryodhana, Karna, Drona, Ashvatthama, Dhritarashtra... the Mahabharata spares no one, even Bhagavan Krishna. The thing that makes it easier for accepting such things is because people in the story own up to it. Yes, Krishna is a shrewd person and will ask you to fight your family no matter what. <em>Watchu gonna do?</em>\n<br><br>\nIf it seems that this section has been more thorough, it's because I've given much more thought to the story of Mahabharata, because it intrinsicly allows me to. I am not implying that Ramayana is not thought provoking, but there are more such moments in Mahabharata where one can ponder on the actions of the people involved in detail.\n<br><br>\nThe Mahabharata is many things, and also a reminder that decline of Dharma means one thing - the end of order in society and destruction of beings. Vyasadeva pleads people as he finishes his magnum opus to tread the path of Dharma, for their sake and for the good of the world.\n<br><br>\nBoth of these epics are the very soul of this nation, this civilization. These are also a peek into the past, where people adhered to Dharma, when the people were pure in their deeds. One can certainly not replicate this time, but one can learn from these epics about self and society. About family and nation. Acceptance and survival. About Dharma, Bharata and her people.","frontmatter":{"title":"The Valmiki Ramayana and Vyasa Mahabharata","author":"Raunack Tripathi","tags":["Other"],"date":"Nov 23rd 2020","image":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.251851851851852,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/53487ddca3bfb21bd228954ae075cb8c/b94b5/009cover.jpg","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/53487ddca3bfb21bd228954ae075cb8c/039ed/009cover.jpg 608w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/53487ddca3bfb21bd228954ae075cb8c/b94b5/009cover.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/7a833/person.png","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/c2da5/person.png 270w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/7a833/person.png 300w","sizes":"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"}}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"the-valmiki-ramayana-and-vyasa-mahabharata"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2855661546","3649515864","4146590038","63159454"]}

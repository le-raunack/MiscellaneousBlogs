Perhaps I shouldn’t have set my hopes so high, this was an underwhelming reading experience.\n<br><br>\nI am still going to read the rest of the series, there’s a good possibility that my opinions would change. Therefore, I am writing this “review” in a very different style. Since I don’t wanna discourage anyone from picking up this book, I’ll talk about the general premise of the novel and the qualities that would most likely interest prospective readers. For the rest of it, I will just lay down my own thoughts and why this book didn’t work for me. Deal? Alright, here goes then:\n<br><br>\nThe Final Empire is ruled by a Dark Lord. He conquered the land over a thousand years ago and has been ruling since. In the world of this <em>Lord Ruler</em> the sun shines red, the plants grow brown and mists shroud the entire land throughout the year. The nobles live a life of luxury in the capital city of Luthadel while the lower class <em>skaa</em> people live in despair. This is the story of a man and his ambition to overthrow the Evil Ruler and bring peace to the land.\n<br><br>\nSounds like a standard fantasy story doesn’t it? <strong>It is</strong>.\n<br><br>\nBut there’s a catch. Sanderson had a specific thing in mind when writing this book down – to write a The-Chosen-One-Brings-Down-the-Dark-Lord-And-Saves-The-World type of story but with a certain twist… a twist he spoils in many of his videos. I won’t, keep guessing lol.\n<br><br>\nI would, however, tell you that Kelsier <em>is</em> somewhat of a non-standard “Chosen One” character. His ambitions originate from a sense of personal revenge instead of an unconditional will to fix things. On top of that, he has a questionable moral compass and so are many his actions. But he is still a legendary figure among the oppressed, a “light of hope” as one can put it, and there’s a hint that he takes pleasure in his fame. An interesting character to say the least.\n<br><br>\nOh, by the way, he is not the main character. That would be <strong>Vin</strong>, the illegitimate daughter of a nobleman, who has lived her entire life in the streets of Luthadel as a lowly thief. She is a young girl who has been taught by her brother to never trust anybody. Kelsier sees her hidden <em>Allomantic</em> abilities (more on that in a sec) and takes her on as an apprentice. Thereby, she learns to use her abilities and becomes an important part of Kelsier’s rebellion.\n<br><br>\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the book is its magic system – <em>Allomancy</em>. It’s the ability to “burn” metals within one’s body and gain certain powers as a result. Burning Tin heightens one’s senses, burning pewter enhances physical abilities. Some metals allow their users to control other’s emotions while others bestow magnet-like abilities which have some interesting applications. Most can only burn one kind of metal and gain its specific ability, but there are rare individuals like Kelsier and Vin who can burn all of them. They are called the <em>Mistborn</em>. The book has a lot of fight scenes that showcase the various abilities attached to <em>Allomancy</em> and I am sure many will find joy in reading through them.\n<br><br>\nSanderson has done a great job into presenting a world ruled by darkness. I already mentioned the extremely <strong>misty</strong> nature of this world but that is further accompanied by mysterious fog monsters who feed on dead things and constant “ash falls”. The entire physical setting of the novel screams “DARKNESS!!!”. Now I cannot confirm this, but I have heard rumours that your hands can turn black and grow spikes if you hold this book for longer periods of time.\n<br><br>\n<em>Anyways</em>, that was my attempt at recommending the book on a neutral standpoint. Now it’s time for personal thoughts…\n<br><br>\nThis has been the weakest Sanderson book for me so far. While it was a smooth read and I finished it fairly quickly, I had a hard time actually caring for anything that happened throughout the book’s length. Kelsier, Vin and maybe the Dark Lord were the only characters I developed a semblance of investment into. While the Dark Lord’s status as an uber-threatening being is well-realized and Kelsier’s quirks are conveyed nicely, Vin is a total Mary Sue. She masters her abilities way too quickly and seems to do everything perfectly. Other than that, it feels like this book could have been much shorter, a lot of events seemed pointless and the “plan” to defeat the Dark Lord drags for way too long. Despite the interesting aesthetics, the world-building felt weak… Especially after having read the author’s other works.\n<br><br>\nThat said, it’s quite possible I had unrealistic expectations going into this book. Maybe <em>Stormlight Archive</em> wasn’t the best place to start after all. Maybe I would have appreciated this one more if it was my first Sanderson book. As I previously stated, I don’t intent on dropping the series. Hopefully the rest of the trilogy will change my thoughts for the better.\n<br><br>\nTill then, I leave you guys with this strangely written review…</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Review of The Final Empire (Mistborn #1)","author":"Shubham Gupta","tags":["Book","Reviews"],"date":"Jan 3rd 2021","image":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.251851851851852,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/3465e58a981d5941ac988ba687575380/b94b5/014cover.jpg","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/3465e58a981d5941ac988ba687575380/039ed/014cover.jpg 608w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/3465e58a981d5941ac988ba687575380/b94b5/014cover.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/a9a3e/noimage_person.png","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/c2da5/noimage_person.png 270w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/a9a3e/noimage_person.png 400w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a-review-of-the-final-empire-mistborn-1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2855661546","3649515864","4146590038","63159454"]}

It will be fun.” but instead you finish the first book with the thought “Dear God, that was wonderful\". That’s Ursula K. Le Guin’s ‘A Wizard of Earthsea’.\n<br><br>\nA lot can be said about this book – it has a solid protagonist, a nicely built world, an interesting magic system; but most importantly – an incredible prose. It might be a fairly generic fantasy book, but the prose and the overall presentation bumps it up to the higher tiers of the genre.\n<br><br>\nThe story follows Ged, a young mage from the island of Gont who discovers his abilities very early on. He goes to a prestigious magic school to learn the art and embarks on a merry adventure around Earthsea fighting evil and helping others…. except, that’s not quite how it happens. In a fit of pride he ends up unleashing an “evil” power on the world which could spell major trouble if it gets to him.\n<br><br>\nBut Ged is not Aragorn who would head straight to Mordor to face the mysterious evil forces head on. As his pride shatters, he spends his days being afraid of the shadows. Although he does great deeds on the way, he does so as he runs away from this one threat he couldn’t understand. As the readers follows Ged’s journey, they would see a cocky young mage develop into the wise old wizard character (not even 20 years old though) we all love.\n<br><br>\nThe series features a magic system which is pretty intriguing. In the world of Earthsea, everything and everyone has a True Name. If that Name is known, the thing or individual can be controlled by the one who utters it. But one must not go too far with the magic, as bringing unneeded change to the world can have massive consequences. It’s a magic system which is hard to explain in a few words, makes more sense when one reads the book.\n<br><br>\nAs for the setting of the series – “Earthsea”, one may consider it a precursor to Hoenn (7/10 too much water). I have heard the other books develop the world much more, but we don’t see a whole lot of it in the first one. Of course, there are places of interest which are built nicely: the magic school of Roke Island, the island of Pendor overrun by Dragons, among others. But for the most part, the reader is on the sea hopping through the various islands that dot this world.\n<br><br>\nOf course, one cannot talk about this book without mentioning the prose. Ursula K. Le Guin’s beautiful prose is perhaps the most notable feature of the series. It turns an otherwise generic fantasy story into a masterpiece. I am sure any reader who picks up the book would be mesmerized by the writing style. As such, getting through the book requires a little bit of effort, but it’s an effort which is rewarding.\n<br><br>\nThis book is a fine example of a coming-of-age story. Although I saw the ending coming, the presentation of the actual scene still managed to take my breath away. The theme of growth and “knowing thyself” is presented in a beautiful manner through the journey of its protagonist. The story is full of images which are straight up jaw-dropping: most notably the scene that features a certain dragon on a tower, and the “final confrontation” at the “edge of the world”.\n<br><br>\nAll in all, a wonderful little book that exceeded my expectations. Much recommended and excited to read the rest.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Book 1 of the ‘Earthsea’ Cycle)","author":"Shubham Gupta","tags":["Book","Reviews"],"date":"Nov 12th 2020","image":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.251851851851852,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ad4f941bc03f30bc9396456857b332ec/b94b5/006cover.jpg","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ad4f941bc03f30bc9396456857b332ec/039ed/006cover.jpg 608w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ad4f941bc03f30bc9396456857b332ec/b94b5/006cover.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/a9a3e/noimage_person.png","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/c2da5/noimage_person.png 270w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/a9a3e/noimage_person.png 400w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a-wizard-of-earthsea-book-1-of-the-earthsea-cycle"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2855661546","3649515864","4146590038","63159454"]}

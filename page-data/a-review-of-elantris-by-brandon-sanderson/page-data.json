Having gone through “Way of Kings” and “Words of Radiance”, a set of mightily impressive books, I decided to go back and read the rest of the author’s bibliography before continuing with Stormlight. Although I went into Elantris with low expectations, this was quite a pleasant reading experience and actually exceeded my expectations in some ways.\nElantris used to be beautiful city resided by Godlike beings. The Elantrians could perform all kinds of magical feats such as healing and teleportation. Anyone in the country of Arelon has the potential to become an Elantrian, the phenomena known as “The Shaod” could turn any normal human into a divine individual. But one day, the city loses its light. The Elantrians lose their magical abilities for unknown reasons and become zombielike husks. As a result – the city is sealed off from the society, the political landscape shifts drastically all over the land and anyone who catches the “Shaod” is sent off to the “cursed” city where they lead a wretched life.\n<br><br>\nThe novel follows three POV characters. Roaden, the Crown Prince of Arelon, catches the Shaod and is exiled to Elantris. There he decides to unravel the mysteries of the cataclysm that befell the city and hopefully rebuild the society. Sarene, the Princess of Teod, who was supposed to tie a political knot with Raoden, comes to Arelon only to find out that her fiancée is dead. Now she must use her wits to try and fix the nation’s political scene and prevent a crusade. Hrathen, the High priest of Fjorden, sent on a mission to convert the people of Arelon to the religion of “Shu-Dereth” and instigate the said crusade.  Each of these characters bring something interesting to the table.\n<br><br>\nSarene’s story follows her attempts at fitting into the patriarchal society of Arelon (having come from the progressive nation of Teod herself) and deal with its messy administration. She joins us with a group of “rebels” who wish to change the way things work in the nation. However, this so-called “rebellion” is almost entirely diplomatic and the people in this group come up with some interesting ways to fix things.\nHrathen is the supposed villain of this story. Being responsible for a religious massacre of a country in the past, he regrets his actions and wishes to convert the people of Arelon in a peaceful (yet deceitful) manner. Standing in his way is his own subordinate who wishes to see “heretics” die a horrible and painful death.\nRaoden is a Prince who is exiled to Elantris after he catches the Shaod and pronounced dead to the countrymen. His story is by far the most interesting part of the novel. Following Raoden, the reader sees the terrible state of the dead city of Elantris and the utter sufferings of its undying prisoners. Raoden vows to rebuild this society and bring hope to its people once again. Joining fellow Elantrian Galladon, he starts finding ways to convince the other “lords” of the city to join his cause and do something nice for the people who have lost all hope. But behind all this is the mystery of the fall of Elantris and and the magic the place used to have. When not making people clean up the filth, he buries himself into books to search for answers.\n<br><br>\nThere is lot that makes this novel a worthy fantasy read. A Magical City that mysteriously loses its magic; The theological warfare of a far-away whose religious hierarchy is unbelievably rigid; the country that lies in the shadow of Elantris, its administration quite literally promotes vanity and it’s anyone’s guess how it managed to avoid invasions for a decade with its weak military force; and finally the duality of culture that can be seen between the previously mentioned country of Arelon and the more progressive Teod. Even with my limited experience with the genre as of now, I can tell that this book does things differently.\nThat said, as the three core stories come together two-thirds of the way into the novel, it turns into a generic fantasy affair. Not a deal-breaker in any way but a downgrade in my opinion. The novel apparently won’t get a sequel until the fifth Stormlight book comes out so the reader will be left with some unanswered question by the end of the book. Regardless, Sanderson’s debut novel was a unique reading experience which I would recommend to anyone interested in the <em>fantasy</em> genre. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Review of Elantris by Brandon Sanderson","author":"Shubham Gupta","tags":["Book","Reviews"],"date":"Nov 6th 2020","image":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.251851851851852,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/eb8b137dfae0f89b3069670eea49a760/b94b5/012cover.jpg","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/eb8b137dfae0f89b3069670eea49a760/039ed/012cover.jpg 608w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/eb8b137dfae0f89b3069670eea49a760/b94b5/012cover.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/a9a3e/noimage_person.png","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/c2da5/noimage_person.png 270w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/a9a3e/noimage_person.png 400w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a-review-of-elantris-by-brandon-sanderson"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2855661546","3649515864","4146590038","63159454"]}

But reading this book on the first day of 2021 – having gone through some tough days – this line hit pretty close to home for me. Ursula K. le Guin’s <em>The Tombs of Atuan</em> – my word, this book is fantastic!\n<br><br>\nA little girl - thought to be the reincarnation of the high priestess of the Tombs of Atuan – is taken from her home in order to raise her to be the new high priestess of the <em>Kargish</em> Empire. Stripped of her name, she is consecrated into the service of the <em>Nameless One</em> and henceforth goes by the name <em>Arha</em>. She grows up within the walls of the tomb being taught her various duties, performing various rituals, exploring the vast labyrinth of the tomb and brutally punishing “unbelievers” whenever needed. Despite her apparent luxury, Arha lives a life of loneliness and isolation. Her world is disrupted when she meets a man – an intruder in the Tombs of Atuan – one who goes by the name of <em>Sparrowhawk</em>.\n<br><br>\nThe wizard lurks in the labyrinth to search for the other half of the ring he received on that island a long time ago. Arha develops a strange friendship with this outsider. Going against the teachings of the ones she serve – she decides not to get the intruder killed; only imprisoned in the massive maze of darkness. As her interactions with the wizard grow, the chains that have bounded her since childhood start to weaken and she finally starts to question her own situation. She must make a choice – to continue living the cursed life or to break the chains and be born again.\n<br><br>\nThe second book of <em>Earthsea</em> is a deeply personal story, even more so than the first one. The amazing prose returns, but the reader spends their time confined to one place instead of journeying around the world of Earthsea and exploring its many wonders. We accompany Arha in her casual strolls around the dark labyrinth of the <em>Tombs</em>, discovering its many terrible chambers littered with the smell of death, suffering and owl poop. Certainly not a pleasant place.\n<br><br>\nLe Guin delves deep into the psyche of our main character. The isolation she feels comes through clearly and so does the darkness she has been raised into. She struggles with her own identity and she keeps fulfilling the role she was forced into as a wee child. Sparrowhawk comes into her life like a Gandalf and shows her the light…. figuratively and literally. He makes her realize that she could attain freedom and be reborn, but <strong>she</strong> needs to be the one who makes the choice.\n<br><br>\nHowever, a change of one’s circumstances is not a smooth experience and the book does not forget that. A life of freedom might be desirable but it’s not one can easily manage. The memories of one’s past actions don’t help either as they hover around like ghosts. Arha doesn’t know a life different from her own nor a world outside the walls of the <em>Tombs</em>. It’s a hard step she must take and show great determination following through.\n<br><br>\nIn just about 150 pages, Le Guin has weaved a beautiful tale that ruffled a whole bunch of emotions. A worthy sequel to <em>A Wizard of Earthsea</em>, retaining all of its good points and more. Personally speaking, feels like I picked the perfect book to start the year with…</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Review of The Tombs of Atuan by Ursula Le Guin","author":"Shubham Gupta","tags":["Book","Reviews"],"date":"Jan 1st 2021","image":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.251851851851852,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/04644d83b2107fe3e8e31c16648210ef/b94b5/013cover.jpg","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/04644d83b2107fe3e8e31c16648210ef/039ed/013cover.jpg 608w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/04644d83b2107fe3e8e31c16648210ef/b94b5/013cover.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/a9a3e/noimage_person.png","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/c2da5/noimage_person.png 270w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/a9a3e/noimage_person.png 400w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a-review-of-the-tombs-of-atuan-by-ursula-le-guin"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2855661546","3649515864","4146590038","63159454"]}

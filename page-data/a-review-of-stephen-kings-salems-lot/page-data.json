A small town becoming the victim of a Vampire's invasion and the main characters being forced to fight off the threat, couple that with a whole lot of violence, gore and shock. While that is a mostly accurate description of the novel, what makes it stand out is its presentation.\n<br><br>\nThe novel is written in a way that the namesake town of 'Salem's Lot becomes a character of its own. A major chunk of the novel is dedicated to describing the people, the geography, and most interestingly' the 'personality' of the town.  It's a town which has a questionable history, has a very brooding nature and likes to 'keep secrets'. And right on the pinnacle of this town stands the notorious Marsten House.\n<br><br>\nThe house that 'looms' over the entire town forms the origin of the chaos that engulfs the town and its people. A sense of dread and fear is created as we slowly get to know the town and the many characters that inhabit it. We are introduced to a number of characters in a fairly short amount of time and we witness their lives as they go about their usual business. Although there are some characters the reader spends more time with compared to the other, King makes sure we get into the shoes of half the population of the town at least once. Most importantly ' the reader comes face-to-face with the darkness most of the inhabitants hide within themselves.\n<br><br>\nThe influence of Bram Stoker's Dracula and the countless Hollywood adaptations is abundantly clear while reading the novel. The novel revels fully in the Vampiric lore. Garlic, Crosses, Wooden stakes, Coffins, every imagery connected to the myth is on display in its pages. The reader would see many parallels with Bram Stoker's classic gothic novel ' the novel doesn't try to be subtle about it whatsoever and that's not necessarily a bad thing.\n<br><br>\nThe novel has a slow build-up, during which the reader starts to get a sense of impending doom. One feels as if anything could go wrong at any moment, as they do throughout the narrative. The gradual build-up of dread and violence culminates in a Climax that would keep readers on edge as the chaos finally hit with full force and the safety of the characters is far from ensured.\n<br><br>\nOf course, the novel may not appeal to everyone. The slow pace and overabundance of characters could turn most readers off. Personally, it's only my second Stephen King novel and I found it inferior to the author's debut novel -Carrie. But, there's a high chance that 'Salem's Lot would appeal to you much more than it did to me.\nAll in all, a solid entry in Stephen King's vast bibliography and a nicely presented vampire story.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Review of Stephen King's 'Salem's Lot","author":"Shubham Gupta","tags":["Reviews"],"date":"Nov 6th 2020","image":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.251851851851852,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/783a3e3218f0621d36fe71934b6a4cec/b94b5/003cover.jpg","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/783a3e3218f0621d36fe71934b6a4cec/039ed/003cover.jpg 608w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/783a3e3218f0621d36fe71934b6a4cec/b94b5/003cover.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/a9a3e/noimage_person.png","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/c2da5/noimage_person.png 270w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/a9a3e/noimage_person.png 400w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a-review-of-stephen-kings-salems-lot"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2855661546","3649515864","63159454"]}

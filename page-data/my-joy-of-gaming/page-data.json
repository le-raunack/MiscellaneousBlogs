You come home and eat your lunch. Some time later you load up the game you bought and start playing it. You mum puts <em>Rasna</em> beside you which she made an entire bottle of during the start of the summer. Your parents are asleep, your windows are covered curtains and it's middle of a summer day in a quiet colony. It's just you and the game you wanted to play.\n<br><br>\nSuch are my memories of my childhood and gaming. Growing up in a middle-class Indian household, I wasn't aware of your Nintendos and Gameboys. Only that video games existed. Loading up 999-in-ONE games ever all the craze in my friend circle.\n<br><br>\nNeedless to say, as I spent more time on the internet, I learned a lot more about video games. And subsequently started playing the games that interested me. Soon I got into Steam and bought a lot of games. Of course, being in line with other gamer brothers of mine, I play only a handful of them. Well, at least spending all that money helped me relate to memes.\n<br><br>\nSo what actually interests me to keep playing these games? It's not a feeling that I can precisely articulate. I am sure the dopamine released in my brain after I complete missions that are categorized as \"tough\" in the GTA community in second attempt or the clout I get after an Ace-Clutch in CS:GO have something to do with it. Yes, I did just flex. Anyways, I think this is something that a lot of gamers will reciprocate with. Some like the game-play aspect of games others play for the story and visuals. If I absolutely have to point out a certain theme, I'd say the theme of adventure. And hence, I like open-world games a lot more than games of other genres. Just the joy of exploring, going to new places, and as the games are progressing technically, just driving around and seeing the NPCs just... <em>do</em> things is something else.\n<br><br>\nNow, this blog doesn't have any intellectual import and is just an opinion of mine. Might even seem a rather pointless blog for some reading. But I wanted to start with this for gaming. Hopefully, as I play more awesome games in the future, I shall be more articulate with my words and also give you something worthwhile to read.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My Joy of Gaming","author":"Raunack Tripathi","tags":["Games"],"date":"Nov 5th 2020","image":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAJABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIEAQX/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAQL/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAYnygNcwQSf/xAAXEAEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgAQ/9oACAEBAAEFAphdUoK6eO//xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQEf/aAAgBAwEBPwGH/8QAFhEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAR/9oACAECAQE/AaV//8QAGBABAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAhEDH/2gAIAQEABj8C1sW9J7//xAAeEAABAgcBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhMUGRobHB8P/aAAgBAQABPyFNtRH2oag54GpT2CY//9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABDf/wD/xAAYEQACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhMf/aAAgBAwEBPxBJGFH/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEP/aAAgBAgEBPxBl/8QAIBABAAEDAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARMUEQIVFhcYGx8P/aAAgBAQABPxAiq0AuIRWxG6yGXmnERU+YT6ukbPZ9tP8A/9k=","aspectRatio":2.251851851851852,"src":"/static/d39fae15d849718ef9fd051ad1fcaf7e/b94b5/002cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d39fae15d849718ef9fd051ad1fcaf7e/039ed/002cover.jpg 608w,\n/static/d39fae15d849718ef9fd051ad1fcaf7e/b94b5/002cover.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/7a833/person.png","srcSet":"/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/c2da5/person.png 270w,\n/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/7a833/person.png 300w","sizes":"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"}}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"my-joy-of-gaming"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2855661546","3649515864","63159454"]}

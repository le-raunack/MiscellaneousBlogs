I have discussed how many institutions have been compromised to misrepresent the Dharmic faith and how one needs to start learning their true history to counter these things. Let us take a took at from where one can get this \"true\" history.\n<br><br>\nRight off the bat, one can't find \"true\" history for many topics. There are cotentions regarding events as late as 1930s (and probably even later) that make it difficult to make a coherent, chronological timeline of historical events. Point is, you may learn sometimes from various articles and books and they may not agree with each other. This is not always the case, but there is a good chance you may run into such problems. Such disagreements are even more apparent when a historical record is being translated from a foreign language to a more vernacular one.\n<br><br>\nIt is also very important that one must read history without any bias. It is because of this very biased approached that our intellectuals have taken that our institutions have contempt for Bharatiya Civilization. As mentioned in the earlier article, history is gray. There are marvellous bright spots but also dark corners. The intention should not be to rewrite them or to reject them, but to accept them altogether.\n<br><br>\nNow, with those disclaimers out of the way, let's get into the actual topic. Learning history, such a daunting task won't be served on a silver platter. If anything, it's more of a domino effect. You find something, then you find another thing relating to the thing you learned earlier. Same is the case for historians as well. You find one historian, then they may quote other historians. The domino effect as already begun with you reading this article.\n<br><br>\nWithtout any hesitation, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TIinExile\" class=\"link\">TrueIndology</a> is THE repository for history regarding <em>many</em> things. Don't let his name fool you, he specializes in histories of <strong>many</strong> civilizations and countries. He openly challenges fake historians and proves them wrong. It is better to not fight TrueIndology and make a fool out of yourself. We have knocked down many dominos beginning with mentioning TI. But TrueIndology is only an individual and is continously under attack. He has even had his twitter account disabled for quoting verses from the Holy Quran. Another great historian who has immense knowledge and continoulsy takes on more civilizational issues is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Koenraad_Elst\" class=\"link\">Dr. Koenraad Elst</a>. He not only makes sharp tweets, has written books, but has also collaborated with organizations like Upword and Sangam Talks.\n<br><br>\nAh yes, yes, we are stepping up from individuals to organizations. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/upword_\" class=\"link\">Upword</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sangamtalks\" class=\"link\">Sangam Talks</a> (or Srijan Foundation) have provided <strong>many</strong> historians, linguists, writes, authors, archaeologists and other people who have immense knowledge to share with the world regarding Dharma and Dharmic civilization a platform. Their videos are very detailed, comprehensive and simple so that even a beginner can understand their presentations on various topics. Once you begin watching their videos and reading their (the individuals involved in giving these presentations) works, you will have a very good idea about where Dharma and Dharmic civilization lies when you compare it to its contemporaries in the past and present. You also have other journal-based platforms like <a href=\"https://pragyata.com/\" class=\"link\">Pragyata</a>, which was co-founded by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Infinitchy\" class=\"link\">Ashish Dhar</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dharmadispatch.in/\" class=\"link\">Dharma Dispatch</a>, founded by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dharmadispatch\" class=\"link\">Sandeep Balakrishna</a>, who also has written many books.\n<br><br>\nThe many works of Ram Chandra Majumdar Ji, Shri Aurobindo, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.in/Rewriting-Indian-History-Francois-Gautier/dp/8187943270/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3PGR0IZJA3JYI&dchild=1&keywords=rewriting+indian+history&qid=1605194390&sprefix=rewritting+indi%2Caps%2C316&sr=8-3\" class=\"link\">Rewriting Indian History by Francois Gautier Ji</a>, works of Rajeev Malhotra Ji are a very good place to start. As you watch and read their works, you will continue with the domino effect and come to know about more historians who present the real Indian history and also about the historians who place their Marxist theory above truth.\n<br><br>\nThis article would be <strong>incomplete</strong> without mentioning the corpus of Dharmic literature that we are blessed with. The Vedas, the Puranas and obviously, the Itihasa texts of Ramayana and Mahabharata cannot be recommended enough for one to read. Yes, they are considered mythological but by people who haven't read them or who have some other agenda of their own. From the Vedas to Mahabharata, you see how the Bharatiya civilization was flourishing when many others were only rising. You see many geographical changes and Dharmic ethics evolving over time. Uncontested in their stories, their teachings and their philosophies, these epics and compositions are a reminder that Bharatavarsha and her people were foremost among their contemporaries in thought and action. An average Hindu can't understand Sanskrit or maybe even read their mother tongue, in which the epics are even more delightful, so one can opt for English translations. Kisari Mohan Ganguli, Manmath Dutt, Bibek Debroy etc., are good translators so take you pick.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Building a Bharatiya Narrative - Where to begin?","author":"Raunack Tripathi","date":"Nov 13th 2020","tags":["Civilization"],"image":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/43978e2b995dcd1eaa785fa557595de0/cfbc8/007cover.jpg","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/43978e2b995dcd1eaa785fa557595de0/6dc0c/007cover.jpg 128w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/43978e2b995dcd1eaa785fa557595de0/0c30b/007cover.jpg 256w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/43978e2b995dcd1eaa785fa557595de0/cfbc8/007cover.jpg 512w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/43978e2b995dcd1eaa785fa557595de0/d1c17/007cover.jpg 768w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/43978e2b995dcd1eaa785fa557595de0/c83f4/007cover.jpg 1024w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/43978e2b995dcd1eaa785fa557595de0/29667/007cover.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/56e34/person.png","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/2c344/person.png 128w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/714e6/person.png 256w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/56e34/person.png 300w","sizes":"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"}}}]},"fields":{"slug":"building-a-bharatiya-narrative-where-to-begin"}}},{"node":{"id":"14f04a56-72c8-5e57-91af-d7edec04053a","html":"<p>Ever pick a fantasy series thinking “Heh, just gotta casually explore some nice magic world with dragons and stuff. It will be fun.” but instead you finish the first book with the thought “Dear God, that was wonderful\". That’s Ursula K. Le Guin’s ‘A Wizard of Earthsea’.\n<br><br>\nA lot can be said about this book – it has a solid protagonist, a nicely built world, an interesting magic system; but most importantly – an incredible prose. It might be a fairly generic fantasy book, but the prose and the overall presentation bumps it up to the higher tiers of the genre.\n<br><br>\nThe story follows Ged, a young mage from the island of Gont who discovers his abilities very early on. He goes to a prestigious magic school to learn the art and embarks on a merry adventure around Earthsea fighting evil and helping others…. except, that’s not quite how it happens. In a fit of pride he ends up unleashing an “evil” power on the world which could spell major trouble if it gets to him.\n<br><br>\nBut Ged is not Aragorn who would head straight to Mordor to face the mysterious evil forces head on. As his pride shatters, he spends his days being afraid of the shadows. Although he does great deeds on the way, he does so as he runs away from this one threat he couldn’t understand. As the readers follows Ged’s journey, they would see a cocky young mage develop into the wise old wizard character (not even 20 years old though) we all love.\n<br><br>\nThe series features a magic system which is pretty intriguing. In the world of Earthsea, everything and everyone has a True Name. If that Name is known, the thing or individual can be controlled by the one who utters it. But one must not go too far with the magic, as bringing unneeded change to the world can have massive consequences. It’s a magic system which is hard to explain in a few words, makes more sense when one reads the book.\n<br><br>\nAs for the setting of the series – “Earthsea”, one may consider it a precursor to Hoenn (7/10 too much water). I have heard the other books develop the world much more, but we don’t see a whole lot of it in the first one. Of course, there are places of interest which are built nicely: the magic school of Roke Island, the island of Pendor overrun by Dragons, among others. But for the most part, the reader is on the sea hopping through the various islands that dot this world.\n<br><br>\nOf course, one cannot talk about this book without mentioning the prose. Ursula K. Le Guin’s beautiful prose is perhaps the most notable feature of the series. It turns an otherwise generic fantasy story into a masterpiece. I am sure any reader who picks up the book would be mesmerized by the writing style. As such, getting through the book requires a little bit of effort, but it’s an effort which is rewarding.\n<br><br>\nThis book is a fine example of a coming-of-age story. Although I saw the ending coming, the presentation of the actual scene still managed to take my breath away. The theme of growth and “knowing thyself” is presented in a beautiful manner through the journey of its protagonist. The story is full of images which are straight up jaw-dropping: most notably the scene that features a certain dragon on a tower, and the “final confrontation” at the “edge of the world”.\n<br><br>\nAll in all, a wonderful little book that exceeded my expectations. Much recommended and excited to read the rest.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (Book 1 of the ‘Earthsea’ Cycle)","author":"Shubham Gupta","date":"Nov 12th 2020","tags":["Book","Reviews"],"image":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ad4f941bc03f30bc9396456857b332ec/cfbc8/006cover.jpg","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ad4f941bc03f30bc9396456857b332ec/6dc0c/006cover.jpg 128w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ad4f941bc03f30bc9396456857b332ec/0c30b/006cover.jpg 256w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ad4f941bc03f30bc9396456857b332ec/cfbc8/006cover.jpg 512w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ad4f941bc03f30bc9396456857b332ec/d1c17/006cover.jpg 768w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ad4f941bc03f30bc9396456857b332ec/c83f4/006cover.jpg 1024w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ad4f941bc03f30bc9396456857b332ec/29667/006cover.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/0a8d8/noimage_person.png","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/2c344/noimage_person.png 128w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/714e6/noimage_person.png 256w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/0a8d8/noimage_person.png 400w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}]},"fields":{"slug":"a-wizard-of-earthsea-book-1-of-the-earthsea-cycle"}}},{"node":{"id":"aab006d6-2a9c-577b-84bc-1082bbb287cd","html":"<p>In the <a href=\"https://le-raunack.github.io/MiscellaneousBlogs/building-a-bharatiya-narrative-why-is-it-needed\" class=\"link\">pervious article</a>, I emphasised why a Bharatiya Narrative is needed. Not only to preserve the ancient Bharatiya glory, but also to counter blatant misinformation. In this blog, I shall try to express how to accomplish building this narrative.\n<br><br>\nAs mentioned earlier, misinformation and misappropriation of Dharmic ethics and history have been institutionalized in our education system and entertainment media. This should be of no surprise to anyone. Anyone who who has a contention, I ask you: Have you ever heard of Bappa Rawal? Or do you have any idea how the Maratha-Muslim war played out for the generation and a half that it lasted? These are not stories from remote corners of the history, but, an Indian, by the very (de)merit of his education system will not know about these things while an American will know all about the Civil War and Japanese will know about his history. Because such a suppression of information has not been carried out elsewhere. Of course, I dont expect 7<sup>th</sup> grade children to learn, to even taught about literally every major thing that happened on the ancient Indian land but such general absence of great heroes deters an average Hindu child from being proud of his heritage.\n<br><br>\nAnother white-washing of history is done through entertainment media, especially movies. Everybody has heard of <em>Mughal-E-Azam</em>. Ah. Such a romantic story. Or also consider the many tales of <em>Jodha and Akbar</em> or <em>Akbar and Birbal</em>. Fucking Akbar. If you have been paying attention to what this article is aiming for, yes, these are all false. They have <em>some</em> basis like Birbal did exist as one of Akbar's ministers and the princess of Jaipur's king, Harku Bai was indeed married off to Akbar. But in the minds of an average Indian, these stories are of great romance and ingenuity. Not forced conversions, humiliation of Hindus and corruption of ethics. Recently, a new twitter handle has emerged, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GemsOfBollywood\" class=\"link\">Gems of Bollywood</a>, that highlights such mockery and misrepresentation of Dharmics. Not that it matters, but I personally think they are a bit too emotional in their approach but their work has indeed proven one thing: Bollywood enjoys misappropriating Hinduism and Hindus.\n<br><br>\nThere is also the internet bias and this very stupid glorification of the West. It's one thing that Indians are unaware of their own true history, but holy shit, guys, do you not know why the West is so rich? It's not because they are liberal or progressive, whatever those words might mean in current times. Their wealth was built in exchange of demolition of other civilizations. Nothing more, nothing less. The internet bias, too, inherently is Western in nature because people from the West dominate it. I won't expand on this right here, in another blog perhaps.\n<br><br>\nAbove are <em>some</em> common examples that create historical amnesia amongst Hindus. I can also provide the example of glorification of Mughal architectures over Dharmic ones or the humiliation of Hindus on the basis of their festivals and so on.\n<br><br>\nSo. What can one do to combat these things? An average, middle-class Bharatiya can't drastically bring changes to these institutions themselves, because these institutions continue to be controlled by people who have NO regards for Dharma. Now, sure, there can be reforms in education system but if that were to be the case, it would have already happened. Bollywood has the \"right-to-expression\" pass and internet is not controlled by one entity (well, at least to some extent). No, an average, middle-class Bharatiya can not bring reforms directly in these. What can be done, though, is to bring about change in the society which, in turn will bring about changes in these institutions.\n<br><br>\nSince the Vedic days, great Rishis have composed and passed down the Vedas and other texts we have, not in the form of texts but as stories. This peotic, oral recounting of the Ramayana and Mahabharata along with the Vedas and Puranas have preserved their sacred and curiousity-inducing nature, which have been lost in Illiad or Odyssey, another set of epics by another great civilization. Hence, it is a very Bharatiya thing to do, when you talk about these events and stories with other people, hopefully enlightening them as well. Learn about the history. Talk about it. Even if it seems unecessary and sometimes even offensive, truth must prevail.\n<br><br>\nLearn. Because the first thing that is needed is for <strong>you</strong> to know about your history and civilization to bring change in society. Talk to your friends about it even if it seems unwarranted. Educate other people. Make a record of what all you have learned. This is the simplest and cheapest step a Bharatiya can take. And these too, are, inherently Bharatiya in nature. You will get into debates and arguments. There is no escape from these. Be ready with your sources and points because, believe me, most of the time the kind of people you get into arguments will, a) Not know anything about the actual history, b) Cannot comprehend how beautifully all these fit in the Vedic principles. Sure, you will come around some dark things as well. You will learn about things that throw a shade at the dark side of Dharmic society. Fret not, though, for such events are fewer in number when you compare it to the positives. Chances are also that you have a relative, probably a student you is being made read wrong history. Now, the poor child can't write whatever they want in the exam and have to stick to the information provided by their textbook but you can at least educate them with the right course of history so that they realize that what they have read is wrong. Do not, absolutely, in any condition concede to false narratives. Always double check your news and think critically while reading. Think critically in general. Have discussions with yourself. Think about the historic pieces you have learned and ask questions to yourself regarding these.

Shankaracharya won the war of ideology.\n<br><br>\nNot so long ago, under the incentive of <em>Hindavi Swarajya</em> and unmatched leadership of Chhatrapati Shivaji, the Marathas defeated the Muslim tyrants of their times and also established a strong empire that lasted despite fighting <em>everyone</em>. Marathas won the physical war.\n<br><br>\nVery recently, with the combined efforts of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Sri Aurobindo, Dr. Ambedkar and other fighters who took an unambiguous stance against European Imperialism, Bharat got her independence. These people won the political war.\n<br><br>\nAnd now, in the world of digital media and internet basically reducing the information exchange time to zero, we look at another kind of war being waged. This war, is just not an ideological one. Neither does it require physical scuffle but still affects one's political views. We are now fighting a full scale <strong>narrative war</strong>.\n<br><br>\nNarratives are as important as having armies. They are <em>this</em> important because not only do they counter any sort of misinformation, they also help a community be answerable to things that actually may be wrong with them. Sounds hypocritical, right?\n<br><br>\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.opindia.com/tag/delhi-anti-hindu-riots-ground-report/\" class=\"link\">Delhi Riots</a> of late 2019-early 2020, the core of the protests was acting against an \"Anti-Muslim Act\", the Citizenship Amendment Act. Despite the CAA <em>not</em> being anti-muslim in any way, shape, or form, the narrative pushed it to be all the same. Leading up to the riots and deaths of around 30 people, the narrative only solidified as CAA being anti-muslims. This narrative <em>ignored</em> all the things that were actually wrong with the protests, beginning with the deliberate misunderstanding of the act. The journalists at Opindia have written a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.in/Delhi-Anti-Hindu-Macabre-Violence-December-ebook/dp/B08DNNWNXR/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1IAO590LX875A&dchild=1&keywords=delhi+anti-hindu+riots+2020&sprefix=delhi+anti%2Caps%2C318&sr=8-1\" class=\"link\">book</a> on the matter which a compilation to all the things building up to the dreaded riots. Even more recently, in the city of Bangalore, another <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/online-hate-turns-into-street-violence-claims-3-lives-in-bengaluru-140-arrested/articleshow/77516669.cms\" class=\"link\">riot</a> took place. Now, this riot was pretty straight forward: Muslims were offended at a post mocking Mohammed which, in turn, was a reply to mockery of Bhagavan Krishna during the Krishna Janmashthami. There is no other work around to this. Yet, the narrative builders on the Left peddled the <a href=\"https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2020/aug/14/watch--youth-form-human-chain-to-protect-hanuman-temple-from-rioters-in-bengaluru-2183111.html\" class=\"link\">\"human chain\"</a> narrative to secularize the issue. Of course, because these narrative builders did not have much time, or a credible story for that fact, this narrative did not succeed unlike the one for CAA riots. I mean, who were these good muslims forming a chain against, exactly?\n<br><br>\nTo touch upon another serious topic that will be fresh in the living memory of many, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Hathras_gang_rape_and_murder\" class=\"link\">Hathras Rape Case</a> came as another shock to the nation. Not only was it another brutal rape case, it also had casteism attached to it. Now, rape problems and sexual assault in India are indeed a serious issue, but what role does exactly caste play in it? How is this particular tragedy in anyway related to caste or casteism? As the case went on, interesting things surfaced that questioned the very foundation of the case. But for the Left, feelings don't care about facts.\n<br><br>\nThese tragedies were all given a communal and casteist angle with how the facts of the cases were exploited to build narratives. Murder is wrong. Rape is wrong. Casteism is wrong. But these are only <em>parts</em> of stories that have been peddled and revealed. Anything, any question that is posed as a threat to these narratives are labelled as being \"communal\" or \"<em>sanghi</em>\" or \"bigotry\". The Bharatiya civilization was again put to question in regards to it's pluralistic identity and it's tolerance. All, on the basis of half-assed narratives.\n<br><br>\nNow, the above mentioned incidents took place only in <em>this</em> year, 2020. These things have been happening since Bharat got her freedom and even before it. Hindus of the Bharatiya civilization look down on their history. Such misinformation has been deliberately institutionalized in education system and in entertainment media. An Indian woke liberal atheist, who may only be a Hindu because Indian Constitution does not recognize atheism, will not know anything beyond the oh, so oppressive caste system or the Sati tradition. Any discussion/debate with them about Bharat's ancestry and you shall be met with ill-informed internet bullies who will use the aforementioned traditions to bring down the culture and say how glorious and older other civilizations were.\n<br><br>\nIn building a Bharatiya narrative, a case for Bharatiyas, one isn't being hypocritical. Calling out baseless finger pointing is not hypocrisy. Fighting misinformation is not hypocrisy. Showing the world the glory of Bharatiya civilization is not hypocrisy. A narrative for protecting Bharat, her timeless history, her civilization values and her people will not be hypocrisy.\n<br><br>\n<em>[to be continued]</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Building a Bharatiya Narrative - Why is it needed?","author":"Raunack Tripathi","date":"Nov 7th 2020","tags":["Civilization"],"image":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/e8e0e3a40ffd3fbfee928c7dc63b848e/cfbc8/004cover.jpg","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/e8e0e3a40ffd3fbfee928c7dc63b848e/6dc0c/004cover.jpg 128w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/e8e0e3a40ffd3fbfee928c7dc63b848e/0c30b/004cover.jpg 256w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/e8e0e3a40ffd3fbfee928c7dc63b848e/cfbc8/004cover.jpg 512w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/e8e0e3a40ffd3fbfee928c7dc63b848e/d1c17/004cover.jpg 768w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/e8e0e3a40ffd3fbfee928c7dc63b848e/c83f4/004cover.jpg 1024w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/e8e0e3a40ffd3fbfee928c7dc63b848e/29667/004cover.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAUCAIAAAAC64paAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAABW0lEQVQ4y52Si26CQBBF9/+/TLBgKK+S1FpltUWwPJQCi5penNQgrEK7mYQF5sydnb3s6c7SNG16WbSX5jDp1wZSVdM0HdcFqUwm05GwqqqGYWzDsKiqUog4TVecz2Yz6mIA1nU9ThJxPAJuQoj6fN5G0RCMDhXldT4H+V2WBNMmL4q+eFcZsM95G6bmR8E4MN9sqluYwnYc/P2zMoVlWQMwfuN62gyqVHWN4Y+aNsQ/gqAtjjO7rtuRlcGahiTP8wCQLDZJlklNxjqWJGX3t3OCs8MBo0bRTgl29aNyWdjgntvTavi63sUxeEq4gfEOP7543sr3v5KkEoJ6bgdmlu7378vls2mqikLnZ3jAuiSFDGD9S7r6DAlwSxhFuHNIMjj5kOf4WpSlFOuXqE+nfZ4DZLZtPwakJdAgjsneFgupGR/DcAFfr9lnEPwDxjHD3Y6lWdaf7WCQc34A/50hGOMhJOoAAAAASUVORK5CYII=","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/56e34/person.png","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/2c344/person.png 128w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/714e6/person.png 256w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/56e34/person.png 300w","sizes":"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"}}}]},"fields":{"slug":"building-a-bharatiya-narrative-why-is-it-needed"}}},{"node":{"id":"424f2790-f3e3-56c1-8213-eaee9204d1a9","html":"<p>Stephen King's second novel, 'Salem's Lot seems to be your everyday Vampire-themed horror novel at first glance. A small town becoming the victim of a Vampire's invasion and the main characters being forced to fight off the threat, couple that with a whole lot of violence, gore and shock. While that is a mostly accurate description of the novel, what makes it stand out is its presentation.\n<br><br>\nThe novel is written in a way that the namesake town of 'Salem's Lot becomes a character of its own. A major chunk of the novel is dedicated to describing the people, the geography, and most interestingly' the 'personality' of the town.  It's a town which has a questionable history, has a very brooding nature and likes to 'keep secrets'. And right on the pinnacle of this town stands the notorious Marsten House.\n<br><br>\nThe house that 'looms' over the entire town forms the origin of the chaos that engulfs the town and its people. A sense of dread and fear is created as we slowly get to know the town and the many characters that inhabit it. We are introduced to a number of characters in a fairly short amount of time and we witness their lives as they go about their usual business. Although there are some characters the reader spends more time with compared to the other, King makes sure we get into the shoes of half the population of the town at least once. Most importantly ' the reader comes face-to-face with the darkness most of the inhabitants hide within themselves.\n<br><br>\nThe influence of Bram Stoker's Dracula and the countless Hollywood adaptations is abundantly clear while reading the novel. The novel revels fully in the Vampiric lore. Garlic, Crosses, Wooden stakes, Coffins, every imagery connected to the myth is on display in its pages. The reader would see many parallels with Bram Stoker's classic gothic novel ' the novel doesn't try to be subtle about it whatsoever and that's not necessarily a bad thing.\n<br><br>\nThe novel has a slow build-up, during which the reader starts to get a sense of impending doom. One feels as if anything could go wrong at any moment, as they do throughout the narrative. The gradual build-up of dread and violence culminates in a Climax that would keep readers on edge as the chaos finally hit with full force and the safety of the characters is far from ensured.\n<br><br>\nOf course, the novel may not appeal to everyone. The slow pace and overabundance of characters could turn most readers off. Personally, it's only my second Stephen King novel and I found it inferior to the author's debut novel -Carrie. But, there's a high chance that 'Salem's Lot would appeal to you much more than it did to me.\nAll in all, a solid entry in Stephen King's vast bibliography and a nicely presented vampire story.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Review of Stephen King's 'Salem's Lot","author":"Shubham Gupta","date":"Nov 6th 2020","tags":["Book","Reviews"],"image":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/783a3e3218f0621d36fe71934b6a4cec/cfbc8/003cover.jpg","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/783a3e3218f0621d36fe71934b6a4cec/6dc0c/003cover.jpg 128w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/783a3e3218f0621d36fe71934b6a4cec/0c30b/003cover.jpg 256w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/783a3e3218f0621d36fe71934b6a4cec/cfbc8/003cover.jpg 512w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/783a3e3218f0621d36fe71934b6a4cec/d1c17/003cover.jpg 768w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/783a3e3218f0621d36fe71934b6a4cec/c83f4/003cover.jpg 1024w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/783a3e3218f0621d36fe71934b6a4cec/29667/003cover.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/0a8d8/noimage_person.png","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/2c344/noimage_person.png 128w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/714e6/noimage_person.png 256w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/0a8d8/noimage_person.png 400w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}]},"fields":{"slug":"a-review-of-stephen-kings-salems-lot"}}},{"node":{"id":"4eb31d23-e237-517e-9985-d0c7526a3478","html":"<p>You are finally done with your 8th grade final exams. You come home and eat your lunch. Some time later you load up the game you bought and start playing it. You mum puts <em>Rasna</em> beside you which she made an entire bottle of during the start of the summer. Your parents are asleep, your windows are covered curtains and it's middle of a summer day in a quiet colony. It's just you and the game you wanted to play.\n<br><br>\nSuch are my memories of my childhood and gaming. Growing up in a middle-class Indian household, I wasn't aware of your Nintendos and Gameboys. Only that video games existed. Loading up 999-in-ONE games ever all the craze in my friend circle.\n<br><br>\nNeedless to say, as I spent more time on the internet, I learned a lot more about video games. And subsequently started playing the games that interested me. Soon I got into Steam and bought a lot of games. Of course, being in line with other gamer brothers of mine, I play only a handful of them. Well, at least spending all that money helped me relate to memes.\n<br><br>\nSo what actually interests me to keep playing these games? It's not a feeling that I can precisely articulate. I am sure the dopamine released in my brain after I complete missions that are categorized as \"tough\" in the GTA community in second attempt or the clout I get after an Ace-Clutch in CS:GO have something to do with it. Yes, I did just flex. Anyways, I think this is something that a lot of gamers will reciprocate with. Some like the game-play aspect of games others play for the story and visuals. If I absolutely have to point out a certain theme, I'd say the theme of adventure. And hence, I like open-world games a lot more than games of other genres. Just the joy of exploring, going to new places, and as the games are progressing technically, just driving around and seeing the NPCs just... <em>do</em> things is something else.\n<br><br>\nNow, this blog doesn't have any intellectual import and is just an opinion of mine. Might even seem a rather pointless blog for some reading. But I wanted to start with this for gaming.

It's a portal to the past based on imprints left by natural forces or great civilizations and subsequently great empires. While remnants left by natural forces help us understand the Earth, the ones by civilizations help us understand the man of the past. Their behavior, society, beliefs et cetera. Any read through of history, and you shall come around some common names. Such as Romans, Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese and the Indians. While smaller civilizations existed everywhere like in parts of South Iraq, earlier known as Sumeria or the indigenous society of then undiscovered North America, the ones mentioned earlier have had a massive impacts in their respective regions and sometimes even dictate the the traditions that have been passed down to the present. While it is debatable which civilization came first, a rather unwarranted debate actually because of the difference of regions and cultures, all these civilizations have existed for millennia. But none of the earlier civilizations have survived to witness the present world or have their ethics survived. All except the Indian, or the Dharmic civilization.<br><br></p>\n<p>It is agreed upon the fact that the region of Indus Valley, or Sindh as the ancient Indians called it, is the cradle of Indian Civilization. The society was built upon the rivers Sindhu and Saraswati. Hence it is also referred to as \"Saraswati-Sindhu\" Civilization. The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro were the first settlements of the civilization and have left their imprints not only in the area itself but other civilizations they had their relations with. Sometime later on, Rakhigarhi became central to the civilization. Now, a baseless argument and a great misconception is that some time later, these settlements \"vanished\" from the face of the Ancient India and soon after the \"Aryans invaded\" the Northern regions of the sub-continent \"bringing India it's culture\". The Aryan Invasion theory has been debunked many times: archaeologically, genealogically, linguistically and all other -allies possible, and hence has been toned down to the \"Aryan Migration\" theory. What even? I will not shit on the theory here but you can just search for it on YouTube. You can watch these for starters: <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bsyi4zYHP0&t=2393s&ab_channel=SangamTalks\">Presentation by Dr. Raj Vedam</a>, <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT05r8VF36g&ab_channel=SangamTalks\">Presentation by Dr. Abhijit Chavda</a> and <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUgoCNtldcQ&t=3s&ab_channel=Arth-ACultureFest\">Panel Discussion about the theory</a>. <br><br></p>\n<p>With the stupid stuff out of the way, let's get to the point. The Hindu civilization has been one of the most powerful civilizations throughout history. This is indicated by the numerous historic records which were made obscure by Western historians for a long time. Indians dominated the whole of South-Eastern Asia including countries like the present day Afghanistan (referred to as Gandhara in Hindu texts), Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and parts of Myanmar, Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia and Philippines in later periods. And of course, including the present day India. Not only that, the Dharmic ethics of ancient India have influenced religions other part of Eastern Asia. A moderate-read of ancient Hindu texts clearly point to the fact that religious philosophy and social order were intermixed with each other and one influenced the other. A few instances include the <strong>Itihasa</strong> texts of Indian literature. Ithasa literally means \"thus-it-happened\" in Sanskrit and are regarded to have historical authority. The two Itihasa texts, Ramayana and Mahabharata are not only some of the greatest stories ever told but also historical records of how the society was in their times. The other scriptures such as the Vedas and Puranas have their own historical authenticity but their theological side is embraced more than the historical. A thorough read-through the corpus of Hindu literature helps us imagine the civilization of the old. Their behaviors, society, beliefs et cetera.<br><br></p>\n<p>But in the times of now, these practices have been just rendered as a religion. There is indeed truth to that attribution but Ethics of War, A Social Order through the Varna-Jaati System, The Rules of Ruling, Preservation of Nature et cetera are all non-religious aspects of the society which are derived from the theology itself. These all strive for <strong>Dharma</strong>, a very nuanced word whose meaning and never be captured by western languages. A disregard of the Vedic principles would mean disregarding the entire civilization. And it's not as if the Indian Civilization was weak. It is strong. Kings and Emperors commanded large armies and dominated large portions of the nation. Yes, indeed, there was a nation. There was no centralized government (rather there have been Emperors who dominated the ancient land), but there was a common culture. From north to south, the civilization followed common ethics and did only differ in the names of kingdoms. They followed <strong>Dharma</strong>.<br><br></p>\n<p>The sciences, art forms, languages, laws and life-style of the common man all derive themselves from the Vedic truth. Of course, that's not to say <em>literally every single thing</em> has it's basis in the Vedas but the most important aspects do. And these traditions have survived the onslaught of various invasions and foreign corruptions. The credit for this lies with none other but the Indians themselves. Common folk preserving their ways of life, Kings preserving common folk, the Acharyas preserving the Vedas amongst other things contributed to the survival of the culture. It sought this as their <strong>Dharma</strong>.<br><br></p>\n<p>To be born in this civilization and realize it's grandeur, I believe it is my <strong>Dharma</strong> contribute in any way I can. How about writing a blogs on this topic for starters, eh?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Sanatana Dharma: Religion or Civilization?","author":"Raunack Tripathi","date":"Nov 4th 2020","tags":["Civilization","History"],"image":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ee7ff5ea4e416bb0e4b3c7d1e0a26cc0/cfbc8/001cover.jpg","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ee7ff5ea4e416bb0e4b3c7d1e0a26cc0/6dc0c/001cover.jpg 128w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ee7ff5ea4e416bb0e4b3c7d1e0a26cc0/0c30b/001cover.jpg 256w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ee7ff5ea4e416bb0e4b3c7d1e0a26cc0/cfbc8/001cover.jpg 512w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ee7ff5ea4e416bb0e4b3c7d1e0a26cc0/d1c17/001cover.jpg 768w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ee7ff5ea4e416bb0e4b3c7d1e0a26cc0/c83f4/001cover.jpg 1024w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ee7ff5ea4e416bb0e4b3c7d1e0a26cc0/29667/001cover.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/56e34/person.png","srcSet":"/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/2c344/person.png 128w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/714e6/person.png 256w,\n/MiscellaneousBlogs/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/56e34/person.png 300w","sizes":"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"}}}]},"fields":{"slug":"sanatana-dharma-religion-or-civilization"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}

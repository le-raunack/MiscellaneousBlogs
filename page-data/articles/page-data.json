Shankaracharya won the war of ideology.\n<br><br>\nNot so long ago, under the incentive of <em>Hindavi Swarajya</em> and unmatched leadership of Chhatrapati Shivaji, the Marathas defeated the Muslim tyrants of their times and also established a strong empire that lasted despite fighting <em>everyone</em>. Marathas won the physical war.\n<br><br>\nVery recently, with the combined efforts of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Sri Aurobindo, Dr. Ambedkar and other fighters who took an unambiguous stance against European Imperialism, Bharat got her independence. These people won the political war.\n<br><br>\nAnd now, in the world of digital media and internet basically reducing the information exchange time to zero, we look at another kind of war being waged. This war, is just not an ideological one. Neither does it require physical scuffle but still affects one's political views. We are now fighting a full scale <strong>narrative war</strong>.\n<br><br>\nNarratives are as important as having armies. They are <em>this</em> important because not only do they counter any sort of misinformation, they also help a community be answerable to things that actually may be wrong with them. Sounds hypocritical, right?\n<br><br>\nIn the<a href=\"https://www.opindia.com/tag/delhi-anti-hindu-riots-ground-report/\" class=\"link\"> Delhi Riots</a> of late 2019-early 2020, the core of the protests was acting against an \"Anti-Muslim Act\", the Citizenship Amendment Act. Despite the CAA <em>not</em> being anti-muslim in any way, shape, or form, the narrative pushed it to be all the same. Leading up to the riots and deaths of around 30 people, the narrative only solidified as CAA being anti-muslims. This narrative <em>ignored</em> all the things that were actually wrong with the protests, beginning with the deliberate misunderstanding of the act. The journalists at Opindia have written a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.in/Delhi-Anti-Hindu-Macabre-Violence-December-ebook/dp/B08DNNWNXR/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1IAO590LX875A&dchild=1&keywords=delhi+anti-hindu+riots+2020&sprefix=delhi+anti%2Caps%2C318&sr=8-1\" class=\"link\">book</a> on the matter which a compilation to all the things building up to the dreaded riots. Even more recently, in the city of Bangalore, another <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/online-hate-turns-into-street-violence-claims-3-lives-in-bengaluru-140-arrested/articleshow/77516669.cms\" class=\"link\">riot</a> took place. Now, this riot was pretty straight forward: Muslims were offended at a post mocking Mohammed which, in turn, was a reply to mockery of Bhagavan Krishna during the Krishna Janmashthami. There is no other work around to this. Yet, the narrative builders on the Left peddled the <a href=\"https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2020/aug/14/watch--youth-form-human-chain-to-protect-hanuman-temple-from-rioters-in-bengaluru-2183111.html\" class=\"link\">\"human chain\"</a> narrative to secularize the issue. Of course, because these narrative builders did not have much time, or a credible story for that fact, this narrative did not succeed unlike the one for CAA riots. I mean, who were these good muslims forming a chain against, exactly?\n<br><br>\nTo touch upon another serious topic that will be fresh in the living memory of many, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Hathras_gang_rape_and_murder\" class=\"link\">Hathras Rape Case</a> came as another shock to the nation. Not only was it another brutal rape case, it also had casteism attached to it. Now, rape problems and sexual assault in India are indeed a serious issue, but what role does exactly caste play in it? How is this particular tragedy in anyway related to caste or casteism? As the case went on, interesting things surfaced that questioned the very foundation of the case. But for the Left, feelings don't care about facts.\n<br><br>\nThese tragedies were all given a communal and casteist angle with how the facts of the cases were exploited to build narratives. Murder is wrong. Rape is wrong. Casteism is wrong. But these are only <em>parts</em> of stories that have been peddled and revealed. Anything, any question that is posed as a threat to these narratives are labelled as being \"communal\" or \"<em>sanghi</em>\" or \"bigotry\". The Bharatiya civilization was again put to question in regards to it's pluralistic identity and it's tolerance. All, on the basis of half-assed narratives.\n<br><br>\nNow, the above mentioned incidents took place only in <em>this</em> year, 2020. These things have been happening since Bharat got her freedom and even before it. Hindus of the Bharatiya civilization look down on their history. Such misinformation has been deliberately institutionalized in education system and in entertainment media. An Indian woke liberal atheist, who may only be a Hindu because Indian Constitution does not recognize atheism, will not know anything beyond the oh, so oppressive caste system or the Sati tradition. Any discussion/debate with them about Bharat's ancestry and you shall be met with ill-informed internet bullies who will use the aforementioned traditions to bring down the culture and say how glorious and older other civilizations were.\n<br><br>\nIn building a Bharatiya narrative, a case for Bharatiyas, one isn't being hypocritical. Calling out baseless finger pointing is not hypocrisy. Fighting misinformation is not hypocrisy. Showing the world the glory of Bharatiya civilization is not hypocrisy. A narrative for protecting Bharat, her timeless history, her civilization values and her people will not be hypocrisy.\n<br><br>\n<em>[to be continued]</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Building a Bharatiya Narrative - Why is it needed?","author":"Raunack Tripathi","date":"Nov 7th 2020","tags":["Civilization"],"image":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/e8e0e3a40ffd3fbfee928c7dc63b848e/cfbc8/004cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e8e0e3a40ffd3fbfee928c7dc63b848e/6dc0c/004cover.jpg 128w,\n/static/e8e0e3a40ffd3fbfee928c7dc63b848e/0c30b/004cover.jpg 256w,\n/static/e8e0e3a40ffd3fbfee928c7dc63b848e/cfbc8/004cover.jpg 512w,\n/static/e8e0e3a40ffd3fbfee928c7dc63b848e/d1c17/004cover.jpg 768w,\n/static/e8e0e3a40ffd3fbfee928c7dc63b848e/c83f4/004cover.jpg 1024w,\n/static/e8e0e3a40ffd3fbfee928c7dc63b848e/29667/004cover.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/56e34/person.png","srcSet":"/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/2c344/person.png 128w,\n/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/714e6/person.png 256w,\n/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/56e34/person.png 300w","sizes":"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"}}}]},"fields":{"slug":"building-a-bharatiya-narrative-why-is-it-needed"}}},{"node":{"id":"424f2790-f3e3-56c1-8213-eaee9204d1a9","html":"<p>Stephen King's second novel, 'Salem's Lot seems to be your everyday Vampire-themed horror novel at first glance. A small town becoming the victim of a Vampire's invasion and the main characters being forced to fight off the threat, couple that with a whole lot of violence, gore and shock. While that is a mostly accurate description of the novel, what makes it stand out is its presentation.\n<br><br>\nThe novel is written in a way that the namesake town of 'Salem's Lot becomes a character of its own. A major chunk of the novel is dedicated to describing the people, the geography, and most interestingly' the 'personality' of the town.  It's a town which has a questionable history, has a very brooding nature and likes to 'keep secrets'. And right on the pinnacle of this town stands the notorious Marsten House.\n<br><br>\nThe house that 'looms' over the entire town forms the origin of the chaos that engulfs the town and its people. A sense of dread and fear is created as we slowly get to know the town and the many characters that inhabit it. We are introduced to a number of characters in a fairly short amount of time and we witness their lives as they go about their usual business. Although there are some characters the reader spends more time with compared to the other, King makes sure we get into the shoes of half the population of the town at least once. Most importantly ' the reader comes face-to-face with the darkness most of the inhabitants hide within themselves.\n<br><br>\nThe influence of Bram Stoker's Dracula and the countless Hollywood adaptations is abundantly clear while reading the novel. The novel revels fully in the Vampiric lore. Garlic, Crosses, Wooden stakes, Coffins, every imagery connected to the myth is on display in its pages. The reader would see many parallels with Bram Stoker's classic gothic novel ' the novel doesn't try to be subtle about it whatsoever and that's not necessarily a bad thing.\n<br><br>\nThe novel has a slow build-up, during which the reader starts to get a sense of impending doom. One feels as if anything could go wrong at any moment, as they do throughout the narrative. The gradual build-up of dread and violence culminates in a Climax that would keep readers on edge as the chaos finally hit with full force and the safety of the characters is far from ensured.\n<br><br>\nOf course, the novel may not appeal to everyone. The slow pace and overabundance of characters could turn most readers off. Personally, it's only my second Stephen King novel and I found it inferior to the author's debut novel -Carrie. But, there's a high chance that 'Salem's Lot would appeal to you much more than it did to me.\nAll in all, a solid entry in Stephen King's vast bibliography and a nicely presented vampire story.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Review of Stephen King's 'Salem's Lot","author":"Shubham Gupta","date":"Nov 6th 2020","tags":["Reviews"],"image":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/c6c252b5fd3d15f039234392f56bdefd/cfbc8/003cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c6c252b5fd3d15f039234392f56bdefd/6dc0c/003cover.jpg 128w,\n/static/c6c252b5fd3d15f039234392f56bdefd/0c30b/003cover.jpg 256w,\n/static/c6c252b5fd3d15f039234392f56bdefd/cfbc8/003cover.jpg 512w,\n/static/c6c252b5fd3d15f039234392f56bdefd/d1c17/003cover.jpg 768w,\n/static/c6c252b5fd3d15f039234392f56bdefd/c83f4/003cover.jpg 1024w,\n/static/c6c252b5fd3d15f039234392f56bdefd/71e93/003cover.jpg 1920w","sizes":"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/0a8d8/noimage_person.png","srcSet":"/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/2c344/noimage_person.png 128w,\n/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/714e6/noimage_person.png 256w,\n/static/471de1a052585ea5e19eb18cad99495a/0a8d8/noimage_person.png 400w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}]},"fields":{"slug":"a-review-of-stephen-kings-salems-lot"}}},{"node":{"id":"4eb31d23-e237-517e-9985-d0c7526a3478","html":"<p>You are finally done with your 8th grade final exams. You come home and eat your lunch. Some time later you load up the game you bought and start playing it. You mum puts <em>Rasna</em> beside you which she made an entire bottle of during the start of the summer. Your parents are asleep, your windows are covered curtains and it's middle of a summer day in a quiet colony. It's just you and the game you wanted to play.\n<br><br>\nSuch are my memories of my childhood and gaming. Growing up in a middle-class Indian household, I wasn't aware of your Nintendos and Gameboys. Only that video games existed. Loading up 999-in-ONE games ever all the craze in my friend circle.\n<br><br>\nNeedless to say, as I spent more time on the internet, I learned a lot more about video games. And subsequently started playing the games that interested me. Soon I got into Steam and bought a lot of games. Of course, being in line with other gamer brothers of mine, I play only a handful of them. Well, at least spending all that money helped me relate to memes.\n<br><br>\nSo what actually interests me to keep playing these games? It's not a feeling that I can precisely articulate. I am sure the dopamine released in my brain after I complete missions that are categorized as \"tough\" in the GTA community in second attempt or the clout I get after an Ace-Clutch in CS:GO have something to do with it. Yes, I did just flex. Anyways, I think this is something that a lot of gamers will reciprocate with. Some like the game-play aspect of games others play for the story and visuals. If I absolutely have to point out a certain theme, I'd say the theme of adventure. And hence, I like open-world games a lot more than games of other genres. Just the joy of exploring, going to new places, and as the games are progressing technically, just driving around and seeing the NPCs just... <em>do</em> things is something else.\n<br><br>\nNow, this blog doesn't have any intellectual import and is just an opinion of mine. Might even seem a rather pointless blog for some reading. But I wanted to start with this for gaming. Hopefully, as I play more awesome games in the future, I shall be more articulate with my words and also give you something worthwhile to read.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My Joy of Gaming","author":"Raunack Tripathi","date":"Nov 5th 2020","tags":["Games"],"image":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/d39fae15d849718ef9fd051ad1fcaf7e/cfbc8/002cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d39fae15d849718ef9fd051ad1fcaf7e/6dc0c/002cover.jpg 128w,\n/static/d39fae15d849718ef9fd051ad1fcaf7e/0c30b/002cover.jpg 256w,\n/static/d39fae15d849718ef9fd051ad1fcaf7e/cfbc8/002cover.jpg 512w,\n/static/d39fae15d849718ef9fd051ad1fcaf7e/d1c17/002cover.jpg 768w,\n/static/d39fae15d849718ef9fd051ad1fcaf7e/c83f4/002cover.jpg 1024w,\n/static/d39fae15d849718ef9fd051ad1fcaf7e/29667/002cover.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/56e34/person.png","srcSet":"/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/2c344/person.png 128w,\n/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/714e6/person.png 256w,\n/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/56e34/person.png 300w","sizes":"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"}}}]},"fields":{"slug":"my-joy-of-gaming"}}},{"node":{"id":"e02ac481-1e6d-5498-9a0f-e53b3f80a99d","html":"<p>History has always been a very intriguing subject. It's a portal to the past based on imprints left by natural forces or great civilizations and subsequently great empires. While remnants left by natural forces help us understand the Earth, the ones by civilizations help us understand the man of the past. Their behavior, society, beliefs et cetera. Any read through of history, and you shall come around some common names. Such as Romans, Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese and the Indians. While smaller civilizations existed everywhere like in parts of South Iraq, earlier known as Sumeria or the indigenous society of then undiscovered North America, the ones mentioned earlier have had a massive impacts in their respective regions and sometimes even dictate the the traditions that have been passed down to the present. While it is debatable which civilization came first, a rather unwarranted debate actually because of the difference of regions and cultures, all these civilizations have existed for millennia. But none of the earlier civilizations have survived to witness the present world or have their ethics survived. All except the Indian, or the Dharmic civilization.<br><br></p>\n<p>It is agreed upon the fact that the region of Indus Valley, or Sindh as the ancient Indians called it, is the cradle of Indian Civilization. The society was built upon the rivers Sindhu and Saraswati. Hence it is also referred to as \"Saraswati-Sindhu\" Civilization. The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro were the first settlements of the civilization and have left their imprints not only in the area itself but other civilizations they had their relations with. Sometime later on, Rakhigarhi became central to the civilization. Now, a baseless argument and a great misconception is that some time later, these settlements \"vanished\" from the face of the Ancient India and soon after the \"Aryans invaded\" the Northern regions of the sub-continent \"bringing India it's culture\". The Aryan Invasion theory has been debunked many times: archaeologically, genealogically, linguistically and all other -allies possible, and hence has been toned down to the \"Aryan Migration\" theory. What even? I will not shit on the theory here but you can just search for it on YouTube. You can watch these for starters: <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bsyi4zYHP0&t=2393s&ab_channel=SangamTalks\">Presentation by Dr. Raj Vedam</a>, <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT05r8VF36g&ab_channel=SangamTalks\">Presentation by Dr. Abhijit Chavda</a> and <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUgoCNtldcQ&t=3s&ab_channel=Arth-ACultureFest\">Panel Discussion about the theory</a>. <br><br></p>\n<p>With the stupid stuff out of the way, let's get to the point. The Hindu civilization has been one of the most powerful civilizations throughout history. This is indicated by the numerous historic records which were made obscure by Western historians for a long time. Indians dominated the whole of South-Eastern Asia including countries like the present day Afghanistan (referred to as Gandhara in Hindu texts), Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and parts of Myanmar, Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia and Philippines in later periods. And of course, including the present day India. Not only that, the Dharmic ethics of ancient India have influenced religions other part of Eastern Asia. A moderate-read of ancient Hindu texts clearly point to the fact that religious philosophy and social order were intermixed with each other and one influenced the other. A few instances include the <strong>Itihasa</strong> texts of Indian literature. Ithasa literally means \"thus-it-happened\" in Sanskrit and are regarded to have historical authority. The two Itihasa texts, Ramayana and Mahabharata are not only some of the greatest stories ever told but also historical records of how the society was in their times. The other scriptures such as the Vedas and Puranas have their own historical authenticity but their theological side is embraced more than the historical. A thorough read-through the corpus of Hindu literature helps us imagine the civilization of the old. Their behaviors, society, beliefs et cetera.<br><br></p>\n<p>But in the times of now, these practices have been just rendered as a religion. There is indeed truth to that attribution but Ethics of War, A Social Order through the Varna-Jaati System, The Rules of Ruling, Preservation of Nature et cetera are all non-religious aspects of the society which are derived from the theology itself. These all strive for <strong>Dharma</strong>, a very nuanced word whose meaning and never be captured by western languages. A disregard of the Vedic principles would mean disregarding the entire civilization. And it's not as if the Indian Civilization was weak. It is strong. Kings and Emperors commanded large armies and dominated large portions of the nation. Yes, indeed, there was a nation. There was no centralized government (rather there have been Emperors who dominated the ancient land), but there was a common culture. From north to south, the civilization followed common ethics and did only differ in the names of kingdoms. They followed <strong>Dharma</strong>.<br><br></p>\n<p>The sciences, art forms, languages, laws and life-style of the common man all derive themselves from the Vedic truth. Of course, that's not to say <em>literally every single thing</em> has it's basis in the Vedas but the most important aspects do. And these traditions have survived the onslaught of various invasions and foreign corruptions. The credit for this lies with none other but the Indians themselves. Common folk preserving their ways of life, Kings preserving common folk, the Acharyas preserving the Vedas amongst other things contributed to the survival of the culture. It sought this as their <strong>Dharma</strong>.<br><br></p>\n<p>To be born in this civilization and realize it's grandeur, I believe it is my <strong>Dharma</strong> contribute in any way I can. How about writing a blogs on this topic for starters, eh?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Sanatana Dharma: Religion or Civilization?","author":"Raunack Tripathi","date":"Nov 4th 2020","tags":["Civilization","History"],"image":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/ee7ff5ea4e416bb0e4b3c7d1e0a26cc0/cfbc8/001cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ee7ff5ea4e416bb0e4b3c7d1e0a26cc0/6dc0c/001cover.jpg 128w,\n/static/ee7ff5ea4e416bb0e4b3c7d1e0a26cc0/0c30b/001cover.jpg 256w,\n/static/ee7ff5ea4e416bb0e4b3c7d1e0a26cc0/cfbc8/001cover.jpg 512w,\n/static/ee7ff5ea4e416bb0e4b3c7d1e0a26cc0/d1c17/001cover.jpg 768w,\n/static/ee7ff5ea4e416bb0e4b3c7d1e0a26cc0/c83f4/001cover.jpg 1024w,\n/static/ee7ff5ea4e416bb0e4b3c7d1e0a26cc0/29667/001cover.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/56e34/person.png","srcSet":"/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/2c344/person.png 128w,\n/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/714e6/person.png 256w,\n/static/ce5dcf72b65a54b839fe1b461eb1cf01/56e34/person.png 300w","sizes":"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"}}}]},"fields":{"slug":"sanatana-dharma-religion-or-civilization"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}

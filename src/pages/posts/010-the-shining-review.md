As I stubbornly make my way through Stephen King’s bibliography, strictly sticking to the release order, I reach a book I was particularly excited about. And let me tell you - it lived up to the hype. “The Shining” is amazing, it’s terrifying, it’s a bit weird, it triggers me at multiple points (and I am not using the word lightly) and it was a joyous read.
<br><br>
Jack Torrance gets a job as the caretaker of the hotel, “The Overlook”, during its off-season. His family accompanies him as they stay at the hotel, cut-off from the world during the harsh winter season. But Danny, the son with the psychic abilities, senses something terribly wrong with the hotel. As one man struggles to keep his sanity, the invisible residents of the hotel creep closer.
<br><br>
The premise sounds an awful lot like a Haunted House story, but don’t let it fool you. The dysfunctional family i.e., the Torrances and their relationship to each other is pivotal, perhaps even central, to the story. The entire first half of the novel is dedicated to introducing the characters to the reader, and King makes sure we delve into their minds as much as possible. It’s made perfectly clear that the family has got a history with domestic abuse and alcoholism. But they are on the path of getting over all of that… or are they?
We get into the minds of the characters as we read and suffice to say, we get to know them pretty well. Danny, the boy who <em>shines</em>, understands things a boy his age shouldn’t. He senses things, both familial and supernatural, and tries his best to protect himself and his family. Wendy is a woman who is bordering on getting sick of her marriage. But she trudges on and tries to keep the family tied together. And Jack Torrance – a failed teacher, a failing father and husband, a recovering alcoholic and a struggling writer – he is a man who has done certain “bad things” in the past. We <strong>really</strong> get to know this man and thus get to experience his descent into madness first-hand. Whole chapters are dedicated to each of these characters, along with the good Mr. Hallorran, complete with vivid accounts of their inner thoughts and varied perspectives towards the strange things happening around them.
<br><br>
Speaking of strange happenings, we might as well consider the hotel one of the main characters of the novel. The Overlook, built on a scenic mountain range, promises good times to each of its visitor. A guest may witness during his stay – sounds of a non-existent party taking place in the empty ballroom, a man prancing around in a dog costume, a dead woman in the bathtub of their suite, random blood spats on the walls, hedge animals playing “It” with their kids – surely a lovely place one must avoid at all costs.
<br><br>
Siphoning off Danny’s psychic powers, named “The Shining” by Mr. Hallorran, the hotel gains power and its influence over the family grows ever stronger. As the reader goes through the novel, a sense of fear grows gradually as the strange “hallucinations” start to appear here and there. A strong sense of isolation is felt as the characters themselves are cut off from the outside world during a season of heavy snowfall. Although a particularly powerful psychic despite being only five, it’s a mystery whether Danny’s powers (and the entity known as “Tony”) are there to help him or to bring his family to their doom. In what I have started to recognize as the typical <em>Stephen King fashion</em>, the slow buildup leads to a process of downfall that keeps the reader glued to the pages of the book, fearful about the fate of the characters yet dying to know what happens next.
<br><br>
But is it really the hotel instigating all of the terrible things, or is it a case of an entire family going insane? Are the “hallucinations” really just hallucinations or something more? After all, Jack’s history of committing “bad things” had nothing to do with the hotel. Well, that’s up to the reader to find out.
Although only my third Stephen King book as of writing this, I can say that this is a good starting point. It seems to showcase King’s prowess as a horror writer pretty well and his writing style seem to shine bright here. That said, I am inclined to put up a <strong>Trigger Warning</strong> here. The book deals with the themes of domestic abuse and violence which may unsettle some readers. Be mindful if any of that bothers you. If not, definitely pick this one up!

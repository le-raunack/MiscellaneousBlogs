The Emperor is ruthless, the Scholar is depressed, giant blue men are wreaking havoc and Everything’s on Fire. <em>Welcome to the final book in Brandon Sanderson’s Mistborn trilogy.</em>
<br><br>
Where the first book seemingly sets up the stage and the second raises a whole lot of questions, the third book delivers a finale that is both satisfying and shocking. No loose end is left tangled and all the answers are here along with some crispy post-apocalyptic fantasy goodness.
<br><br>
The book starts out with an unexpected Wild West atmosphere, with Elend going around helping folks deter the threat of angry Blue Hulks. Some of these ventures end better than the others. The fact that the End of the World is nigh is made very clear and it’s up to our characters to solve the puzzles Lord Ruler left behind to hopefully stop the moon from colliding onto Termina. This impending sense of doom is presented very nicely and the tension keeps on rising throughout the length of the book until reaching an eventual peak.
<br><br>
All of our surviving characters are here, most of them changed for the better after the events of the previous book. Elend makes good progress with his newfound Allomantic abilities, Sazed not so much with his Post Traumatic Theist Crisis. Vin is still a Mary Sue but turns out she needs to be something much more to deal with the Evil God Ruin. Also... Spook is here, and he has an interesting character arc? Certainly didn’t expect that.
<br><br>
Sazed’s crisis forms an integral part of the book as he searches for answers across the many religions he has documented, looking for <strong>something</strong> that would help alleviate the pain of his loss. He finds Catharsis in the most unexpected way possible. Spook, on the other hand, goes on a merry adventure of turning into an Anime Protagonist, saving a city under a questionable political regime. Furthermore, we have Tensoon who goes to the Kandra homeland to try and convince his people to fight.
<br><br>
As for our heroine Vin, she continues to look for meaning behind the strange occurrences around her. Wondering whether she really is the prophesied “Hero of Ages”. But if so, what does it even mean to be a Hero of Ages? After all, everything that has been written in this desolate world has been corrupted with lies and half-truth. Regardless, all she can do is keep moving forwards…
The Mistborn trilogy is not one with the best worldbuilding, but that makes sense if you think about it. After all, it’s a desolate world covered with mist with nothing especially notable in it. In fact, these three books (Often dubbed as “Mistborn First Era”) are pretty much the early history of the book.
<br><br>
That said, the third book has some interesting tidbits about the world revealed. Chief among these is the Kandra side of the stories. We learn about the world and culture of these strange shape-shifting beings in great detail. The social hierarchy of these creatures, their unique fashion sense and the secrets hidden by the elders of the Kandra are certainly interesting to say the least. 
<br><br>
We also learn more of the history of the world which was ruled by Lord Ruler and the terrifying implications of the written nature of this history. The terrible power that wants to see the world burn may have more control over it than initially thought and who knows how deeply his strings go?
<br><br>
All of this leading to a Climactic Showdown which is of a scale that one expects to see at the end of a Fantasy Epic. Vin’s showdown with Ruin and his agents, Elend’s last stand against the army of Kolloss who wish to destroy everything, the world holds its breath as its fate hangs in the balance. Anyone who has managed to reach this far is in for a treat.
<br><br>
And that was the first trilogy of the Mistborn trilogy. While it started off weak for me, it picked up pretty quickly in the second book (changing my thoughts on the first book in the process) and didn’t disappoint. Putting Stormlight Archive on hold in order to explore the rest of the “Cosmere” was a good idea. Reading through Sanderson’s other popular series has really got me excited for the rest of the larger series and I can’t wait to see where this Interplanetary Fantasy journey would go.

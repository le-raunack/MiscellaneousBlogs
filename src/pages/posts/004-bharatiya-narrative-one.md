Centuries ago, the great souled Adi Shankara Acharya defeated the anti-vedic ideology with only his words and his exceptional command over the subject. Shankaracharya won the war of ideology.
<br><br>
Not so long ago, under the incentive of *Hindavi Swarajya* and unmatched leadership of Chhatrapati Shivaji, the Marathas defeated the Muslim tyrants of their times and also established a strong empire that lasted despite fighting *everyone*. Marathas won the physical war.
<br><br>
Very recently, with the combined efforts of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Sri Aurobindo, Dr. Ambedkar and other fighters who took an unambiguous stance against European Imperialism, Bharat got her independence. These people won the political war.
<br><br>
And now, in the world of digital media and internet basically reducing the information exchange time to zero, we look at another kind of war being waged. This war, is just not an ideological one. Neither does it require physical scuffle but still affects one's political views. We are now fighting a full scale **narrative war**.
<br><br>
Narratives are as important as having armies. They are *this* important because not only do they counter any sort of misinformation, they also help a community be answerable to things that actually may be wrong with them. Sounds hypocritical, right?
<br><br>
In the <a href="https://www.opindia.com/tag/delhi-anti-hindu-riots-ground-report/" class="link">Delhi Riots</a> of late 2019-early 2020, the core of the protests was acting against an "Anti-Muslim Act", the Citizenship Amendment Act. Despite the CAA *not* being anti-muslim in any way, shape, or form, the narrative pushed it to be all the same. Leading up to the riots and deaths of around 30 people, the narrative only solidified as CAA being anti-muslims. This narrative *ignored* all the things that were actually wrong with the protests, beginning with the deliberate misunderstanding of the act. The journalists at Opindia have written a <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Delhi-Anti-Hindu-Macabre-Violence-December-ebook/dp/B08DNNWNXR/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1IAO590LX875A&dchild=1&keywords=delhi+anti-hindu+riots+2020&sprefix=delhi+anti%2Caps%2C318&sr=8-1" class="link">book</a> on the matter which a compilation to all the things building up to the dreaded riots. Even more recently, in the city of Bangalore, another <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/online-hate-turns-into-street-violence-claims-3-lives-in-bengaluru-140-arrested/articleshow/77516669.cms" class="link">riot</a> took place. Now, this riot was pretty straight forward: Muslims were offended at a post mocking Mohammed which, in turn, was a reply to mockery of Bhagavan Krishna during the Krishna Janmashthami. There is no other work around to this. Yet, the narrative builders on the Left peddled the <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2020/aug/14/watch--youth-form-human-chain-to-protect-hanuman-temple-from-rioters-in-bengaluru-2183111.html" class="link">"human chain"</a> narrative to secularize the issue. Of course, because these narrative builders did not have much time, or a credible story for that fact, this narrative did not succeed unlike the one for CAA riots. I mean, who were these good muslims forming a chain against, exactly?
<br><br>
To touch upon another serious topic that will be fresh in the living memory of many, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Hathras_gang_rape_and_murder" class="link">Hathras Rape Case</a> came as another shock to the nation. Not only was it another brutal rape case, it also had casteism attached to it. Now, rape problems and sexual assault in India are indeed a serious issue, but what role does exactly caste play in it? How is this particular tragedy in anyway related to caste or casteism? As the case went on, interesting things surfaced that questioned the very foundation of the case. But for the Left, feelings don't care about facts.
<br><br>
These tragedies were all given a communal and casteist angle with how the facts of the cases were exploited to build narratives. Murder is wrong. Rape is wrong. Casteism is wrong. But these are only *parts* of stories that have been peddled and revealed. Anything, any question that is posed as a threat to these narratives are labelled as being "communal" or "*sanghi*" or "bigotry". The Bharatiya civilization was again put to question in regards to it's pluralistic identity and it's tolerance. All, on the basis of half-assed narratives.
<br><br>
Now, the above mentioned incidents took place only in *this* year, 2020. These things have been happening since Bharat got her freedom and even before it. Hindus of the Bharatiya civilization look down on their history. Such misinformation has been deliberately institutionalized in education system and in entertainment media. An Indian woke liberal atheist, who may only be a Hindu because Indian Constitution does not recognize atheism, will not know anything beyond the oh, so oppressive caste system or the Sati tradition. Any discussion/debate with them about Bharat's ancestry and you shall be met with ill-informed internet bullies who will use the aforementioned traditions to bring down the culture and say how glorious and older other civilizations were.
<br><br>
In building a Bharatiya narrative, a case for Bharatiyas, one isn't being hypocritical. Calling out baseless finger pointing is not hypocrisy. Fighting misinformation is not hypocrisy. Showing the world the glory of Bharatiya civilization is not hypocrisy. A narrative for protecting Bharat, her timeless history, her civilization values and her people will not be hypocrisy.

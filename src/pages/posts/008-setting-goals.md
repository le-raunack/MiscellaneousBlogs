Writing blogs and articles like these always keeps you on your feet. And couple that with the kind of subjects that I am interested in, as of 2020, history and civilization, there are no limits to learning. And this is something I want to discuss here.
<br><br>
Learning about things, in my experience has been just a process of bettering yourself from a previous stage on that subject, which may include the starting point of "no idea". Just as a child "learns" to speak and "learns" to walk, though such actions are very common in animal kingdom, they are not something inherent like "smiling" or "crying"; emotions in general. Such learning is also not limited to academic knowledge of sciences. And it is for this reason, the fact that you can learn about anything at anytime, through books or discussions or experience, there is no limit to learning.
<br><br>
The more you learn, the more you can talk about. The more you can indulge yourself in different parts of the society. I am not saying it is necessary by any means but for content writers it is very important. And often times you may not know what to write, a halt in your writing. Or you may be not able to write spontaneously. Often times, because you don't know how to begin or expand their contents or for the more learned of us, _what_ to write about even.
<br><br>
Now, I haven't really suffered from this. Definitely sometimes here and there but for the most part I've been fine. But this did get me thinking that I _will_ one day experience such a thing. I may not know what to write about one day. And as one thing leads to another, I also came to the realization that in the grand scheme of learning, I am not that well-learnt at all. There are a lot of things I need to read and discover about. Something as basic as the common language of Bharat, Sanskrit, which has its traces in majority of Bharatiya languages, is not known to me. Blaming the education system won't suffice here, though it should take majority of the blame. At the end of the day, the responsiblity is mine to learn the language itself, along with a thousand different things.
<br><br>
I am also very interested in coding, gaming and movies. But I am not a level where I can write comprehensive articles or blogs relating to those subjects because I just lack the analytical skills to do so, inspite of these subjects holding great value for me. I may even come back to some of the blogs that I've written and correct them. Not edit those blogs directly, but to address any topics I may have changed views on or better knowledge of. So, here's what I've decided, to set a goal for myself.
<br><br>
It's 2020, the time of me writing this. I have decided to be more learned about these subjects, history, civilization, gaming, coding and movies by the year 2025. I don't necessarily mean expand my knowledge exponentially but more than what I have write now. Some of you may say, "Duh! That will definitely happen.". Yea, well, not really. I've seen a lot of people stay uninformed about subjects that I discussed with them few months or even few years ago. Of course, they may be about things that don't interest them and they might be learning about subjects that do but this idea of being stagnant in your views, not challenging yourself in your ideals seems very dull to me. And no, I don't have this "holier than thou" sentiment right now, just a realization born out of how little a knowledge that I have.
<br><br>
It's only apt that I practise what I preached in <a href="https://le-raunack.github.io/MiscellaneousBlogs/building-a-bharatiya-narrative-what-can-be-done" class="link">this article</a>. That I be a bit more wiser, a bit more knowledgeable and a lot more interested to learn in the coming years, is what I hope. Sorry if this one came out as a long rant.

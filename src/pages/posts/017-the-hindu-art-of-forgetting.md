In the year 1442, when Vijayanagara Empire was firmly established in the south, the then king of the empire, Deva Raya II as we will call him, "began to consider more seriously his situation" vis-a-vis his enemies. Vijayangara was richer than other kingdoms. It had more soldiers in its army than other kingdoms. Then why were they losing all the battles? He consulted the Brahmanas and other administrators of his kingdom and they gave him two reasons: Lean animals (horses primarily) of Deccan lands and <em>the superior archers his enemies had</em>.
<br><br>
Deva Raya II would go on appease the Muslims in his army by ordering Hindus of his kingdom to leave them alone in their religious affairs, install the Quran beside his throne so that they could pray infront of him and also "made his Hindu soldiers learn the discipline of the bow".
<br><br>
Anyone who has followed or learned about the great heroes of Bharatiya Sabhyata know that these heroes were excellent archers. Ramachandra, Pandava Arjuna, Pandava Bhimasena, Gangaputra Bhishma, Bharadwaja Drona etc., to name a few display an extraordinary dexterity with their bows and arrows. Before the allegations of interpolated embellishments are made on these persons, know that story telling is inspired from real life. Whether or not these people could shoot down maces mid-air or destroy entire chariots is not the point. The point is Hindus revered the bow. To a point they would name the bows of their greatest heroes (Gandiva of Arjuna, Shranga of Vishnu, Pinaka of Shiva) much like named katanas in Japan, and named the entire art of warfar after it, <em>Dharnurvidya</em>. Yet, during the time I talked of earlier, a Hindu king had to make his Hindu soldiers "learn the discipline of the bow".
<br><br>
Before we putforth the reasons for decline in the use of archery with advancing technology and the inefficiency of archery that comes with it, the point I am trying to make a bunch of barbaric invaders had better archers than a civilization that revered archery.
<br><br>
This is prevelant even today. And this strain of historical amnesia (if you can call it that) is much worse than forgetting a tactic of warfare. The forgetfulness of Hindus at this time does not make their traditions vulnerable to barbaric tribes but rather the hunger of time what consumes everything that is forgotten. This is in turn being replaces by "modern" Western values which, are best, a reactionary response to years for brutal imperialism, inhuman slavery, literal destruction of all ancient and indigenous civilizations.
<br><br>
Hindus think a family of 4 is ideal, with that number being cut down in increasingly "liberal" families more and more. Hindus think science and religion are two distinct entities, and the latter being regressive. Hindus think history does not play a role in their "modern" lives and can be neglected for a "better" future. Hindus do not think for themselves anymore. And when such anmesia of history and carelessness with tradition gives rise to social evils like forced "sati", discrimanatory caste system, fake <em>baba</em>s, etc., and the blame solely lies on tradition and culture, despite it's their very lack of that such evils even came into being.
<br><br>
The ancient people couldn't be more different than the modern Hindus, who only maybe Hindus in name because the sacrosanct Constitution of India does not allow for atheism. They remembered each and every word of their history, fantastical or not. History is the <em>pramana</em> of prosperity of Hindu civilization. The point is not to get stuck in the rosy days of unparalleled days of past, but to learn from it. To know your history is to know what you inherit and what you are. Be it not important for non-Hindus, but for the inheritors of Vedic civilization, it is paramount to know yourself through the lens of history. For that is how it has eternally been.
